A scraper for Supreme Court opinions and scripts to clean them, i.e. taking them from PDF to plain text with headers, footers, etc. removed. Only opinions from 2003 onwards are available, because the Supreme Court doesn't have others posted.

Everything is available in Ruby.
The web scraper is happens to exist in Python too.
